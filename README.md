Overview
This is a sleek, responsive calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator features a modern design with smooth button interactions and supports basic arithmetic operations as well as more advanced functionality like percentages and exponents.

Features
Basic Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)

Advanced Functions: Percentage (%), Exponentiation (^)

Clear Function: Reset the display with the 'C' button

Decimal Support: Allows floating point calculations

Responsive Design: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

Error Handling: Displays "Error" for invalid expressions

Visual Feedback: Button hover and active states for better user experience

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the calculator structure

CSS3: For styling and animations

JavaScript: For calculator logic and functionality

Installation
No installation required! Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

Usage
Click the number buttons to input values

Use operator buttons (+, -, *, /) for calculations

Press '=' to compute the result

Use 'C' to clear the display

Additional functions:

'%' calculates percentages

'^' raises to a power (exponentiation)

Code Structure
index.html: Contains the calculator layout and button elements

style.css: Handles all styling and visual effects

index.js: Implements the calculator logic with three main functions:

appendToDisplay(): Adds characters to the display

clearDisplay(): Clears the calculator display

calculate(): Evaluates the expression and displays result

Customization
You can easily customize the calculator by modifying the CSS file:

Change colors by modifying the HSL values

Adjust button size by changing the width/height properties

Modify the overall size by changing the calculator's max-width

Change fonts by updating the font-family property

Known Limitations
Using eval() for calculations has security implications in production environments

The calculator doesn't handle very large numbers gracefully

There's no memory function or history of calculations

Future Improvements
Implement a more secure calculation method than eval()

Add keyboard support for number entry

Include a memory function (M+, M-, MR, MC)

Add calculation history display

Implement scientific calculator functions
